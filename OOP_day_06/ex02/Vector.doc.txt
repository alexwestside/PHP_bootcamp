<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Vector Class class handles a convention.

A vector is represented by the following characteristics:
• x magnitude
• y magnitude
• z magnitude
• w coordinate

The Vector Class possess private attributes to represent the four characteristics.

The Class’ constructor is waiting for an array. The following keys are required:
’dest’: the vector’s destination vertex, mandatory.
’orig’: the vector’s origin vertex, optional, by default is worth a new instance of the x=0, y=0, z=0, w=1 vertex.

The Class include a Boolean static attribute verbose to control the displays related to the use of the Class. This attribute is initially False.

The class provides the following methods :
• __toString method.
• __destruct method.
If static attribute verbose is true, then the Class constructor and destructor will produce an output.
• doc method - returns the documentation of the class in a string. Documentation read from a Vector.doc.txt file.
• magnitude() : returns the vector’s length (or "norm").
• normalize() : returns a normalized version of the vector. If the vector is already normalized, returns a fresh copy of the vector.
• add(Vector $arg) : returns the sum vector of both vectors.
• sub(Vector $arg) : returns the difference vector of both vectors.
• opposite() : returns the opposite vector.
• scalarProduct($mult) : returns the multiplication of the vector with a scalar.
• dotProduct(Vector $arg) : returns the angle’sAppendix cosine between both vectors.
• cos(Vector $arg) : returns the angle’sAppendix cosine between both vectors.
• crossProduct(Vector $rhs) : returns the cross multiplication of both vectors (right-hand mark!)
Methods from the Vector Class never modify the current instance.
Your Vector Class have at least the following public methods.
