<- Vertex ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Vertex Class class represent a point in space: the "vertex".

A vector is represented by the following characteristics:
• x axis coordinate
• y axis coordinate
• z depth coordinate
• w coordinate
• color

The Vertex Class possess private attributes to represent the five characteristics.
The vertex color always instance of the Color Class.
The Vertex Class provide reading and writing assessors for five attributes.
The Class’ constructor is waiting for an array.
The following keys are required:
’x’: x axis coordinate.
’y’: y axis coordinate.
’z’: z axis coordinate.
’w’: optional, by default is worth 1.0.
’color’: optional, by default is worth a new instance of the color white.

The Class include a Boolean static attribute called verbose to control the displays related to the use of the Class.
This attribute is initially False.

The class provides the following methods :
• __toString method.
• __destruct method.
If static attribute verbose is true, then the Class constructor and destructor will produce an output.
• doc method - returns the documentation of the class in a string. Documentation read from a Vector.doc.txt file. Vertex.doc.txt.
